Utility-First Approach:

Emphasizes small, single-purpose classes for styling.
Class Naming Convention:

Classes are named intuitively, representing their styles (e.g., bg-blue-500).
Responsive Design:

Breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) for styling based on screen sizes (e.g., md:text-lg).
Flexbox:

flex: Enables a flex container.
items-{alignment}, justify-{alignment}: Aligns items and content.
Spacing:

p-{size}, m-{size}: Sets padding and margin.
Sizing:

w-{size}, h-{size}: Sets width and height.
Borders and Corners:

border, border-{side}-{size}: Adds borders.
rounded, rounded-{size}: Applies rounded corners.
Typography:

text-{size}, font-{weight}: Sets font size and weight.
Background and Color:

bg-{color}, text-{color}: Sets background color and text color.
Shadow and Opacity:

shadow-{size}, opacity-{percentage}: Adds shadow and adjusts opacity.
Spacing Scale:

Predefined scale for consistent spacing.
Text Alignment:

text-left, text-center, text-right: Aligns text.
Display Properties:

hidden, block, inline, inline-block: Adjusts display.
Visibility:

invisible: Makes an element invisible.
Overflow:

overflow-{property}: Handles overflow.
Positioning:

static, relative, absolute, fixed: Controls positioning.
Z-Index:

z-{index}: Sets stacking order.
Cursor:

cursor-{type}: Changes cursor style.
Hover, Focus, and Active States:

hover:, focus:, active:: Apply styles on interaction.
Transitions:

transition-{property}: Adds smooth transitions.
Transforms:

transform-{type}: Applies 2D transformations.
Interactivity:

pointer-events-{type}: Controls pointer events.
Responsive Visibility:

hidden sm:block: Adjusts visibility based on screen size.
Container Utility:

container: Centers and adds max-width for a responsive layout.

Spacing Scale:

Tailwind has a predefined spacing scale (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...) for consistent spacing throughout the design.
Text Alignment:

text-left, text-center, text-right: Aligns text within its container.
Display Properties:

hidden: Hides an element.
block, inline, inline-block: Adjusts the display property of an element.
Visibility:

invisible: Makes an element invisible while still taking up space.
Overflow:

overflow-{property}: Handles overflow, such as overflow-hidden to hide content that overflows its container.
Positioning:

static, relative, absolute, fixed: Controls the positioning of an element.
Z-Index:

z-{index}: Sets the stacking order of an element.
Cursor:

cursor-{type}: Changes the cursor style, e.g., cursor-pointer.
Hover, Focus, and Active States:

hover:, focus:, active:: Apply styles on hover, focus, or when an element is active.
Transitions:

transition-{property}: Adds smooth transitions to specified properties.
Transforms:

transform-{type}: Applies 2D transformations, like scaling or rotating.
Interactivity:

pointer-events-{type}: Controls how an element responds to pointer events.
Responsive Visibility:

hidden sm:block: Adjusts visibility based on screen size.
Container Utility:

container: Centers and adds max-width to an element for a responsive layout.
